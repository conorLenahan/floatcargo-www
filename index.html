<h1>21st-Century Airships to Define 21st-Century Trade.</h1>
  <p>
    We’re building the next generation of airships — more efficient than anything that has ever flown. <br>
    
    They will create a new class of global logistics: 
    a middle layer between ocean and air, moving goods at massive scale and minimal cost. <br>

    It begins here, in a San Francisco warehouse — the first FAA-compliant prototypes taking shape. <br>

    Soon, regional autonomous blimps will replace helicopters in developing markets <br>

    And before the decade closes, we’ll fly some of the largest airships in history — 
    the foundation of a new global logistics network representing a $100 billion annual opportunity. <br>
  </p>

  <h1>Build Something That Matters</h1>
  <p>
    Float is hiring a small team of hardware engineers ready to get their hands dirty. 
    You’ll build what you design, fly what you build, and help shape the future of global logistics. <br>
    If you’re a hardware engineer excited by that prospect, click here to learn more. <br>
